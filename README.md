# genericAddressForm


Hi this is a generic address form, it uses React tree of components. 

inputs for the form are as follows:
firstName,
lastName,
address,
city,
state,
zipcode,
phonenumber,
email

these inputs are stored in react states once the user enter information and submits. I also have validations set up to 
alert the user if any of the inputs is blank. The current value of state at each submit is then added to a list of addresses 
at the bottom of the page. In the console the states are also logged as a hash of key,value pairs.
